# 3DRolling
Slice and peel a 3D model in a spiral fashion to get a representation of the said model in a roll;
laser cut the print and roll it back for a physical 3D model.

This project is the full suite of code for cutting, printing, and rolling (on a rack with machanic parts controlled by an arduino).
